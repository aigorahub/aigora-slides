# Aigora - Sensory Data Presentation App (Eleventy Version)

This project is an Eleventy-based interactive presentation application designed to showcase sensory data insights for Aigora. It aims to provide a dynamic and engaging alternative to traditional PowerPoint presentations. It is styled according to the Aigora 2025 brand guidelines.

This app showcases the benefits of custom web applications for client presentations:
*   **Engagement**: Interactive elements like the dynamic radar chart, real-time word cloud simulation, and predictive analytics tool actively involve the audience, making complex data more understandable and memorable.
*   **Accessibility**: Built with web standards in mind, including ARIA labels and keyboard navigation, ensuring a wider audience can access the content. The responsive design guarantees a consistent experience across devices.
*   **Reusability & Maintainability**: Eleventy's data-driven approach (content in `src/_data/slides.json`) and templating (`.njk` files) allows for easy updates and reuse of presentation structures. This streamlines the creation of future presentations.
*   **Offline Access**: The included service worker enables offline functionality, crucial for reliability during client meetings where internet access might be unstable.
*   **Performance**: Statically generated HTML by Eleventy ensures fast load times.
*   **Modern Aesthetics**: A clean, professional design using Tailwind CSS and Aigora brand guidelines (Cormorant SC and Roboto fonts, Modern Sage and other brand colors) projects a contemporary image for Aigora.
*   **Interactive Components**: Custom JavaScript components like radar charts, word clouds, and a predictive tool allow for real-time data exploration and engagement.
*   **Dark Mode**: User-selectable dark mode for comfortable viewing in different environments.

## Features

*   10-slide presentation flow with smooth GSAP animations.
*   **Interactive Sensory Dashboard (Slide 5)**: Radar chart (Chart.js) comparing two product profiles with a toggle.
*   **Real-Time Feedback Simulation (Slide 6)**: Dynamic word cloud (wordcloud package) updating with sample consumer descriptors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v16 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository (or copy the files into a new project directory).
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-project-name
    ```
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # OR
    # yarn install
    ```

### Running Locally

To start the Eleventy development server:

```bash
npm start
# OR (directly)
# npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

This will typically open the app in your default browser at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Building for Production

To create a production-ready build (static files in `_site` directory):

```bash
npm run build
# OR (directly)
# npx @11ty/eleventy
```

The `_site` folder can then be deployed to any static hosting service like Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.
